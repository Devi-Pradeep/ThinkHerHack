Project Description
Donor Connect is a web platform that connects blood donors with those in need. Users can register as donors, search for available blood types in their area, and send emergency requests to save lives quickly.

The Problem statement
Finding blood donors quickly is very difficult in emergency situations like accidents,rare blood group needs, surgeries etc..
CURRENT ISSUES:
* No real time availability of donors
* Manual searching through contacts in social media
* Lack of location-based filtering
* Blood banks may not always have required blood type
* Time delay can lead to loss of life.

The Solution
* Donors can register and update availability
* Patients or hospital can request blood instantly
* System matches nearest available donors
* Emergency alerts are sent in real-time.
